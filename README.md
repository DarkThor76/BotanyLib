You stumble out of the woods into a clearing... There is not much here. The ground is barren. Nothing grows here, but the soil is fertile.

Eventually this will contain a wealth of details on plants, starting in North America and then eventually working to cover as many plants as possible.

The kinds of information you'll (eventually find here): Identification information: taxonomical name, leaf structure, stem structure, flower type, location, and number. Pictures of each plant and its leaf closeup will be shown. Information about fruits, seeds, and propogation style will also provide assistance to gardeners. The importance on high quality data will be stressed.
